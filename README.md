Context of the project for the DMP:

Cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease, yet over four thousand individuals are expected to die from cervical cancer in 2021 alone (American Cancer Society, 2021). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends Papanicolau (Pap) testing every three years for women aged 21 – 30 (USPSTF, 2016) in order to allow for early detection and treatment. Further, the main cause of cervical cancer is the human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV vaccine is safe and effective at preventing cervical cancer (CDC, 2019b). The HPV vaccine is recommended for all children ages 11-12 years, and for those up to age 26 if not adequately vaccinated (CDC, 2020b). Systemic barriers to care exacerbate cervical cancer incidence disparities among certain populations including communities of color, LGBTQ+ identifying individuals, uninsured individuals, and migrant populations (Buskwofie et al., 2020; CDC, 2020a; Musselwhite et al., 2016; Spencer et al., 2019).
	As such, this study aims to answer the following research questions: 
RQ1: What systems-level barriers do individuals face accessing cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination?
RQ2: How, and to what extent, do racism, gender identity, sexual orientation, access to care, social context, and disability status relate to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination?
RQ3: How do these factors impact adherence to USPTF cervical cancer screening recommendations and HPV vaccine initiation?

Dataset for the DMP:

For this project, I will utilize the survey data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)—an annual telephone survey that collects data on health-related risk behaviors and preventative health services (CDC, 2019a). This collection year includes optional modules that aimed to collect data using a reproductive justice lens including information on health care access, reactions to race, social context, sexual orientation and gender identity. We will also utilize select questions from the demographics module, including race/ethnicity, income level, marital status, education level, and employment status. 
	For the 2014 collection year, there is a combined dataset of landline and cellphone collection method. The combined dataset has three versions that will be utilized in this study: LLCP2014, LLCP14V1 and LLCP14V2. Each dataset includes data from the optional modules that will be utilized in the analysis, as they varied in use by state. The combined dataset that includes Versions 1 and 2 is roughly 51 MB. The dataset is available freely and publicly online for download in SAS Transport Format in order for the file to uploaded to other statistical software. Once this dataset is downloaded, I will need to make a working dataset to create new variables and conduct the statistical analyses. All datasets will be in .CSV files, therefore they can be uploaded to multiple statistical analysis software packages, including R Studio, where the analyses will be conducted.
